A Python script is basically justa text file which you input your python code inorder to build a larger application.

Since the Python interpreter is suitable for small tasks and chunks of code only, Python scripts allow you to build a programs having hundreds or thousands of lines of code, make changes to your code and run it as many times as you want.

The main thing you have to remember here is the each Python file or script must have the '.py' extension, not '.txt' or anything else. Furthermore you can neme your script however you like just as with any other file in your system.

Now, in order to create and edit the text within your Python script, ypu must use a text editor or an IDE(Intergrated Development Environment) - highlights some Python-specific words using predefined colors, just to make your code easier to read.

Now its time to run our small application. We can do that by simply opening the command line or terminal and typing in 'python', a space and then the name of the file we just created.Also remember to add not just  the file name, but also the path to that file  and, very important, .py extension, in this case python scripts.py
