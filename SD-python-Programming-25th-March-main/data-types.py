# Python 3 - Data types

# lets see what types of data can be stored in memory and used inside Python applications.

# The python programming language defines many types of data for many types of oprations. We will look at the most widely used data types.

# As an overview lets enumerate the most famous and useful Python 3 data types ->we have 
# 1. Strings
# 2. Numbers
# 3. Boolean
# 4. Lists
# 5. Sets
# 6. Frozensets
# 7. Tuples
# 8. Ranges
# 9. Dictionaries
# 10. None

# All these data types are built into the Programming core and are clearly defined and easy to use

# One way to classify data types is by whether the objects of a data type can be modified after creation or not -> this is called mutability or immutability

# This leads to types of data types 
# 1. Mutable data types:which can be modified after creation -> Here we can mention lists, dictionaries and sets
# 2. Immutable data types -> which can not be modified after creation -> here we have strings numbers and tuples

# next -> String

a = 2
a = 4
a = 6
print(a)

a = 2
_2a = 6
a2 = 10

print(a2)
